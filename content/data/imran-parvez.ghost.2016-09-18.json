These insights allow your brand to partner with the Right customer, at the right time, to fulfill their purchase intention.\n![cover](/content/images/2015/11/3loq-cover.jpg)\n\n\n##What the project is\nThe product aims at understanding the connections between products and consumers. Over a large data set, these connections can be abstracted to find patterns among the consumers. \n\n##Who the team members are \nA 4 member team worked on this product Data Scientist, Marketing Manager, CEO and Product Designer (me).\n\n##Role and Contribution \nWorking along with the others my role was to gather all the insights from them and involve them into the product design process. The product to be built would be deployed at the banks for their marketing teams.\n\n##How/why the problem exists \nPromotional messages from the banks to their customers are neglected because they do not reach (1) the right customer, (2) at the right time. Communications right now were broadcasted, they needed to be personal. \n\n##Why the problem matters \nThe cost of customer irritation is too high to be ignored.\n\n##Process \nThe team then set out to establish goals and the requirement to attain each goal. \n![image: goals and means](/content/images/2015/11/goals.jpg)\n\n##Understanding the system\n\nThe system made connections between consumers and products from the transaction history. But the connections which came out were so huge in no. and wouldn’t explicitly specify the meaning of the connection. We had to find a better way to make sense out of these connections. \n\nWe collected a few connections picked randomly and started researching on them. To get some insights we presented these to domain experts in banking. With their help, we understood that these randomly picked connections could be clubbed to a limited number. \n\n![Image: connections]\n\nThis led to defining something called as contexts.\n\n###Contexts \n1. behavioral indications which determine the interest to buy a product.\n2. Each product will have a limited set of contexts which will be determined based on the transactions of the customers who already own it.\n\n##Research\nA lot of research was done to gain insight onto the working methodology of Banks. I had gone and spoken to different teams at the Bank. We had also collaborated with other banking experts to gain insight on what the connections meant. \n\n##Solution \nThe final solution had a really simple flow\n\n1. Select a Product\n2. Select a context\n3. Filter consumers falling in that context to create a specific set\n4. Export the list of consumers\n\n##Iterations \n###First\n![First Iterations Landing Screen](/content/images/2015/11/3loqIdea1_0.jpg)\n\nThe Products list which gives the no. of existing customers and potential customers helps agents determine what product to target.\n\nThe idea behind having the action bar was to make the list creation process simple. If these inputs were taken here. The agent can select corresponding contexts in the next screen shown below.\n\n![First Iterations contexts screen](/content/images/2015/11/3loqIdea1_1.jpg)\n\n###Second\nThe second idea was around a wizard kind of pattern to create a list. This solution broke the flow into steps and let the user make limited decisions on each screen.\n\n![Second Iterations Landing](/content/images/2015/11/3loqIdea2_0.jpg)\n####The wizard is a 3 step process\n1.
